		[THEO right serious]
			Are you absolutely sure about this {+MADELINE}?

		[MADELINE_PHONE left distracted]
			I need to know where she went.
			I can't go on like this.

		[THEO right serious]
			I know {+PART_OF_YOU} is important to you. I get you.
			But also consider that most people do not{n}have talking {+ST_BAD}goth doppelg√§ngers{+END_BAD}.
			You have been away from{n}the {+MOUNTAIN} for a while now.
			It is only natural that the{n}effects are wearing off.

		[MADELINE_PHONE left sad]
			I need her.
			With {+GRANNY} gone, she is the{n}only one who can really help me.

		[THEO right serious]
			I may not be {+PART_OF_YOU} but we can talk through this.
			No need to do anything rushed.

		[MADELINE_PHONE left angry]
			You do not understand! A literal {+PART_OF_ME} is gone.

		[MADELINE_PHONE left distracted]
			I am incomplete. {0.7}Broken.

		[THEO right serious]
			{+MADELINE}, don't say such things.
			You are just under a lot of stress right now.

		[MADELINE_PHONE left distracted]
			I need to do this. I will call you later.
			Goodbye.

			The darkness is getting thicker...

	KaydenFox_FactoryMod_1_Factory_A_Entrance=
		[MADELINE left distracted]
			This must be the place all this smoke is coming from.
			{trigger 0 Madeline turns around, waits then goes to the left}
			It is covering the {+MOUNTAIN} side.
			{trigger 1 Madeline turns back towards the entrance}

		[MADELINE left sad]
			If I shut it down, maybe things will go back to normal.

		{anchor bottom}
		[MADELINE left sadder]
			This place is so big.
			Can I really do this alone?

			{trigger 0 Madeline walks forward, camera pans down}

		[MADELINE left sadder]
			This would be so much{n}easier if she was here...

			{trigger 1 Camera pans back}

		{anchor bottom}
		[MADELINE left surprised]
			This must be it!

		[MADELINE left upset]
			If I get rid of its core, the smoke will go away!

		[MADELINE left determined]
			And when it does, the {+MOUNTAIN} will breathe again!

		[MADELINE left sadder]
			I just hope this brings her back...

		[MADELINE left sad]
			I got this far, no stopping me now!

	KaydenFox_FactoryMod_1_Factory_A_Ending=
		{anchor bottom}
		[MADELINE left surprised]
			I did it!

		[MADELINE left peaceful]
			I did it.

		[MADELINE left sad]
			I did on my own.
			But I did it!
			{trigger 0 Madeline stands up, walks left}

		[MADELINE left distracted]
			I could do it alone.

		[MADELINE left sad]
			It was hard, but I could do it.
			Maybe. {0.5} Maybe I can do this.
			If I could do all this alone{n}then maybe I can move on.

		[MADELINE left distracted]
			She could not have disappeared forever.
			{trigger 1 Wait a bit}
		
		[MADELINE left surprised]
			{+THEO}!
			He must be so worried about me!

		[MADELINE left distracted]
			I need to find a pay phone somewhere.
			{trigger 2 walk right, roll credits}
