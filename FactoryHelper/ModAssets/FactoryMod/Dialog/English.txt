		[THEO right serious]
			Are you absolutely sure about this {+MADELINE}?

		[MADELINE_PHONE left distracted]
			I need to know where she went. I can't go on like this.

		[THEO right serious]
			I know {+PART_OF_YOU} is important to you. I get you.
			But also consider that most people do not have talking goth doppelgangers.
			You have been away from the mountain for a while now.
			It is only natural that the effects are wearing off.

		[MADELINE_PHONE left sad]
			I need her. With {+GRANNY} gone, she is the only one who can really help me.

		[THEO right serious]
			I may not be {+PART_OF_YOU} but we can talk through this.
			No need to do anything rushed.

		[MADELINE_PHONE left angry]
			You do not understand! A literal {+PART_OF_ME} is gone.

		[MADELINE_PHONE left sad]
			I am incomplete. {0.7}Broken.

		[THEO right serious]
			{+MADELINE}, don't say such things.
			You are just under a lot of stress right now.

		[MADELINE_PHONE left distracted]
			I need to do this. I will call you later.
			Goodbye.
