# Kayden Fox's Celeste Mods

This repo contains the source code and sometimes other resources of my Celeste mods. Currently there are two mods featured. 
You can find their soruce code by navigating this repository and they both should have their own Readme files that should serve as a documentation.

## [Adventure Helper](https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/9807)

This mod contains variations and extensions to vanilla items that improve and extend their capabilities without changing too much about them.

## [Factory Helper](https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/10260)

Made specifically for **[Shrouded Thoughts](https://gamebanana.com/maps/206930)**, this mod contains a large number of new items and custom assets.
You can use the items provided by it for your own mods however!
